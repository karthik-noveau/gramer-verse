# Font licence

## Noto Sans Tamil — SIL Open Font License 1.1

`noto-sans-tamil-subset.woff2` is a subset of **Noto Sans Tamil**, the variable
weight axis of `NotoSansTamil[wdth,wght].ttf` from
<https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/notosanstamil>.

Copyright 2022 The Noto Project Authors (<https://github.com/notofonts/tamil>).

**The OFL permits redistribution, modification and embedding, including inside a
commercial product, provided the font is not sold on its own and the licence
travels with it.** Subsetting is a modification the licence explicitly allows.
The full text is reproduced below, unaltered — this file is that requirement.
This closes open question 1 in `spec/architecture.md`.

## What was done to it

```text
1. width axis pinned            fonttools varLib.instancer  wdth=100
2. subset                       fonttools subset
     --unicodes  U+0B80-0BFF (the whole Tamil block), U+0020-007E, U+00A0,
                 U+00B7, U+2013-2014, U+2018-201D, U+2026, U+200C-200D,
                 U+25CC, U+0964-0965
     --layout-features='*'      every GSUB/GPOS feature kept
     --name-IDs='*'             the licence stays inside the font file
3. woff2
```

The weight axis is **kept variable, 100–900**, so one file serves every weight
the UI uses.

Two decisions worth keeping:

- **The whole Tamil block, not the glyphs today's content happens to use.**
  Subsetting to observed strings is smaller but silently breaks the first
  lesson that introduces a letter nobody had typed yet.
- **Every layout feature kept.** Tamil is shaped, not merely mapped: `akhn`,
  `psts`, `abvs`, `haln`, `subs` and the `mark`/`abvm` positioning are what put
  the vowel signs where they belong. Dropping them is how a subset ends up
  rendering visible boxes and floating marks — the exact failure the engine
  spec warns about. 285 glyphs, 68.7 KB.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
